<h1>The Cache</h1>
<div class="jumbotron">
  <p>Kata: lack of proper caching can hurt a website's performance. This page has some
  expensive computations that are cached to decrease page load times and yet it's still slow.
  See if you can figure out why.</p>
  <p>Hint: Go to New Relic and create a custom dashboard for the Metric : Custom/compute_sine
  and see if anything sticks out as odd as you refresh the page a few times.</p>
